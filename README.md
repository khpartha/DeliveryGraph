# Delivery Route Optimization Graph

Welcome to the Delivery Route Optimization Graph repository! This project is designed to assist logistics and delivery companies in optimizing their delivery routes while considering constraints like time windows and vehicle capacity. By utilizing graph-based algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s Algorithm, this tool determines the fastest possible routes between locations and validates them against delivery constraints.

## Overview

Efficient route planning is essential for delivery operations to reduce costs, meet time windows, and maximize efficiency. This project provides:

- A graph-based representation of delivery locations and routes.

- Dijkstra’s Algorithm implementation to compute the shortest route based on travel time.

- Route validation, ensuring compliance with time windows and vehicle capacity constraints.

- Error handling, preventing incorrect or infeasible route calculations

## Features

 ## Fastest Route Calculation

- Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the optimal route between two locations.

Considers bidirectional roads with travel times as weights.

Delivery Time Window Constraints

Each location has a time window (earliest and latest delivery time).

Vehicles must reach within this window to ensure successful deliveries.

Vehicle Capacity Validation

Each location has a demand (number of packages to be delivered).

Ensures the total demand does not exceed vehicle capacity.

Graph Representation

Implements an adjacency list to store delivery locations and routes efficiently.

Supports dynamic addition of locations and roads.

Error Handling

Detects and prevents duplicate locations.

Ensures valid routes before computing paths.

Handles scenarios where no valid path exists.

## Workflow Description

- **Data Ingestion**Historical production data is read from a CSV or generated synthetically.
- **Feature Engineering & Model Training**Input features (months) are fed into a scikit-learn or TensorFlow model.
Model learns the relationship between month and production.
- **Prediction**Model predicts production for the next month (or multiple months ahead).
